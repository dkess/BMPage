# How to use
In your Firefox bookmarks, create a folder called "startpage" in your Bookmarks Menu. Then fill that folder with subfolders representing groups. As an example:

```
└── Bookmarks Menu
    └── startpage
        ├── Entertainment
        │   ├── Facebook
        │   ├── Reddit
        │   └── YouTube
        └── Google
            ├── Google
            ├── Maps
            └── News
```

If these bookmarks have keywords assigned to them, those keywords will show up on the startpage. This is useful if you don't like taking your hands off the keyboard!
